`git` Command Tips:
- To stage/"commit" a change, use `git commit -am "{commit message here}"`
- To upload all staged commits, `git push`
- The `git fetch` command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on, which is useful if you want to see what changes have been made on the remote server, without making any changes to your local copies.
- With `git pull`, you additionally merge the origin branch to your local branch. 
- Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

- Link to the (elastic) IP Address of Sam's and my shared running server: http://184.73.129.137
- Registered Domain w/ Namecheap.com http://freelconnect.com
- Terminal command to `ssh` in: `ssh -i [key pair file location] ubuntu@184.73.129.137`
- `exit` is the command to leave

**Internet Hiearchy:**

Application (Has FTP [File Transfer Protocol], SSH, HTTP[80, old]+HTTPS[433] [get/post/delete/put on a webpage], etc. are on their own ports)

^ Transport (**TCP** = slower but reliable, makes reliable connection first to the port, then transports w/ flow control *vs* **UDP** = unreliable but quicker to connect)

 ^ Inernet (from routers using Internet Protocol language [IP], Host-to-Host connection)

  ^ Physical (Machine, uses WiFi to connect to the router)

- Using IP Address is 32-bits, consisting of Source of Destination, allowing for a unique IP Address in the whole world
- IP is unreliable because you don't know what the load/load size is, just starts sending, if it exceeds the buffer size, we lose info
- DNS converts the IP Address into a human-readable/-intelligible name

**History of the Internet:**
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTML (Hyptertext Meta-Language allows us to render complex pages w/ graphics, fonts, etc.), and URL
- CSS lets us style the webpages
- Brendan Eich created JavaScript, provides for interactive elements and dynamic content

Web Browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) --> Web Server (DNS, IP)

**Technology Stack:**
- REACT
- Caddy 2
- Node.js
- MongoDB
*User -> Web Browser (React) -> Internet/HTTPS -> AWS EC2 [Elastic Compute Cloud] Web Server (running Gateway thru Caddy, Node.js Web Services, and Atlas MongoDB) 
         
         *Dev -> VS Code, Git, etc. through ssh ->

**3.1 HTML:** Structuring Web Applications

<(open tag) html(attribute) lang="en"(attribute value)>
</(closing tag) html>

```html
"<!-- commented text -->"

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

Link References:

Absolute:

- <a href="../images/profile.png" />

HTML Tutorial Website = 

HTML element = meaning
html = The page container
head = Header information
title = Title of the page
meta = Metadata for the page such as character set or viewport settings
script = JavaScript reference. Either a external reference, or inline
include = External content reference
body = The entire content body of the page
header = Header of the main content
footer = Footer of the main content
nav = Navigational inputs
main = Main content of the page
section = A section of the main content
aside = Aside content from the main content
div = A block division of content
span = An inline span of content
h<1-9> = Text heading. From h1, the highest level, down to h9, the lowest level
p = A paragraph of text
b = Bring attention
table = Table
tr = Table row
th = Table header
td = Table data
ol,ul = Ordered or unordered list
li = List item
a = Anchor the text to a hyperlink
img = Graphical image reference
dialog = Interactive component such as a confirmation
form = A collection of user input
input = User input field
audio = Audio content
video = Video content
svg = Scalable vector graphic content
iframe = Inline frame of another HTML page

*The HTML elements that represent media include img, audio, video, svg, and canvas. The img, audio, and video elements are all simple references to an external file, but svg and canvas both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.


### 9/23,25/24:

*CSS Notes:*

      body {
        color: red;
      }
      p {
        color: green;
      }
      span {
        color: blue;
      }


In this case, the rules cascade down from the highest nodes in the DOM tree to the lowest level. Any declaration property defined at a lower level will override the higher declaration. You can see this happening if you use the browser's debugger. In Chrome right click on the element and select inspect. You can then click on each element in the debugger and see what the value of the color property is. For the case defined above you will see that each of the higher level declarations is crossed out until you get to the style explicitly defined on the element.

/* */ = a comment

- <style> tags are used in HTML files
- to refer to a CSS external file, you need to use the <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"> tag to the CSS style sheet in the <head></head> tags

*Different Fonts:*

```html
@font-face {
 font-family: 'Quicksand';
 src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.ttf');
}

p:nth-child(1) { /lets you pick which tag in order that they come/
 font-family: Quicksand;
}

OR

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap");

p {
 font-family: "Rubik Microbe";
}
```

*Bold and Italic:*

- font-style: italic;
- font-weight: bold;


*Unicode and UTF-8:*

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8" />
 </head>
 <body>
   <p>ÌïòÎÇòÎãòÏùÄ ÎÇòÏùò ÎπõÏù¥ÏãúÎã§</p>
   <p>üòÉ &#128521;</p>
 </body>
</html>

*Animation:*

@keyframes demo {
 from {
   font-size: 0vh;
 }

 95% {
   font-size: 21vh;
 }

 to {
   font-size: 20vh;
 }
}


p {
 text-align: center;
 font-size: 20vh;

 animation-name: demo;
 animation-duration: 3s;
 OR
 animation: demo 1s infinite alternate;
}
```

The top border = 10 pixels
The bottom border = 5 pixels
The left border = 20 pixels
The right border = 1pixel

border-width:10px 1px 5px 20px;

- text-transform:capitalize  
- list-style-type: square;  
- To select element w/ ID "demo", do #demo
- To select all p elements inside a div element = div p
- group selectors = Separate each selector with a comma
- Def. position property = static

*Margin:*

- Margin is the space outside an element's border.
- It controls the spacing between different elements on the page.
- Margin pushes adjacent elements away to create a gap between them.
- The element's background color does not extend into the margin area.
- Margin can have negative values and the auto keyword.

*Padding:*

- Padding is the space between an element's content and its border.
- It controls the spacing inside an element, around its content.
- Padding increases the size of the element.
- The element's background color extends into the padding area.
- Padding cannot have negative values or use the auto keyword.

Some other key points for differences between *Margin* and *Padding*:
Adjacent vertical margins collapse, taking the largest margin value, while padding values stack.
Margin is for positioning an element in relation to others, while padding is for styling the look of an individual element.
Margins are transparent, while padding takes on the element's background color.


*Display:*

- The CSS display property allows you to change how an HTML element is displayed by the browser. The common options for the display property include the following.

Value	Meaning
none	= Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.
block	= Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A p or div element has block display by default.
inline	= Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A b or span element has inline display by default.
flex	= Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.
grid	= Display this element's children in a grid orientation.

- We can demonstrate the different CSS display property values with the following HTML that contains a bunch of div elements. By default div elements have a display property value of block.

```html
<div class="none">None</div>
<div class="block">Block</div>
<div class="inline">Inline1</div>
<div class="inline">Inline2</div>```
<div class="flex">
  <div>FlexA</div>
  <div>FlexB</div>
  <div>FlexC</div>
  <div>FlexD</div>
</div>
<div class="grid">
  <div>GridA</div>
  <div>GridB</div>
  <div>GridC</div>
  <div>GridD</div>
</div>

.none {
  display: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

Example:
<img width="491" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 11 22 48‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c81de5a9-a072-4762-be55-2d2a8381107a">


*Float:*

The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an aside element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.

aside {
  float: right;
  padding: 3em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  border: black solid thin;
}


*Grid:*

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
</div>

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

*CSS Element References:*

```html
<a class="nav-link" href="#accordionExample">Accordion</a>
```
- Make sure the href=# is to an *ID*, not to a class

**JavaScript:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>My First JavaScript</h2>

<button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
Click me to display Date and Time.</button>

<p id="demo">Will be replaced w/ date</p>

</body>
</html> 
```
*Change HTML Attribute Values:*
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>

<p>JavaScript can change HTML attribute values.</p>

<p>In this case JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an image.</p>

<button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='pic_bulbon.gif'">Turn on the light</button>

<img id="myImage" src="pic_bulboff.gif" style="width:100px">

<button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='pic_bulboff.gif'">Turn off the light</button>

</body>
</html>
```

*Change CSS Style of Element:*
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>

<p id="demo">JavaScript can change the style of an HTML element.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.fontSize='35px'">Click Me!</button>

</body>
</html> 
```


*Hide HTML Elements:*
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>

<p id="demo">JavaScript can hide HTML elements.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='none'">Click Me!</button>

</body>
</html> 
```
- But you can still reactive the HTML element, it's still there!


*Create Window Alert:*
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>My First Web Page</h2>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html> 
```

*Linking to JS File:*
- In the body tags at the bottom
```html
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```


**JavaScript Objects:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Creating JavaScript Objects</h1>
<h2>Using an Object Literal</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an Object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Display Data from the Object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```


*JavaScript Functions:*

- Can be passed as parameters
- Anything nonzero is True, anything 0/empty is False
- having a function `start(fn)` with the param. `fn`, if we didn't give a param., then
- `fn = fn || variables` and if `fn` wasn't given/defined, it will default to the first 'true' value (could be ternary w/ just 2, or mult. with ||)
- Use `===` for true equality
- For anonymous functions i.e. lambdas, use the keyword `function` or `const arrowMethod = (param) => {return a+2;};` that can be void, return a value, and take any # of arguments
- To turn a variable into an active function, use the variable name + () w/ or w/o parameters
- If you return an arrow function w/ a function, you can string the parameters together

```java
dup(duplimit){
  return (t) => {
    ...
    //uses both duplimit and t
  }
}

dup(3)('again');
// 3 is passed in first for duplimit and then 'again' for 3
```

*JavaScript Arrays:*

The Array object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.

Function	Meaning	Example
- push	Add an item to the end of the array	a.push(4)
- pop	Remove an item from the end of the array	x = a.pop()
- slice	Return a sub-array	a.slice(1,-1)
- sort	Run a function to sort an array in place	a.sort((a,b) => b-a)
- values	Creates an iterator for use with a for of loop	for (i of a.values()) {...}
- find	Find the first item satisfied by a test function	a.find(i => i < 2)
- forEach	Run a function on each array item	a.forEach(console.log)
- reduce	Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item	a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)
- map	Run a function to map an array to a new array	a.map(i => i+i)
- filter	Run a function to remove items	a.filter(i => i%2)
- every	Run a function to test if all items match	a.every(i => i < 3)
- some	Run a function to test if any items match	a.some(i => i < 1)

```java
const a = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a.map((i) => i + i));
// OUTPUT: [2,4,6]
console.log(a.reduce((v1, v2) => v1 + v2));
// OUTPUT: 6
console.log(a.sort((v1, v2) => v2 - v1));
// OUTPUT: [3,2,1]

a.push(4);
console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 4
```

*JavaScript Regular Expressions:*

`/pattern/modifiers;`
- ex) /w3schools/i;

Modifiers:

- i	Perform case-insensitive matching	
- g	Perform a global match (find all)	
- m	Perform multiline matching	
- d	Perform start and end matching (New in ES2022)

**Regular Expression Patterns:**

Brackets are used to find a range of characters:

- [abc]	Find any of the characters between the brackets	
- [0-9]	Find any of the digits between the brackets	
- (x|y)	Find any of the alternatives separated with |	
- Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

Metacharacters:

- \d	Find a digit	
- \s	Find a whitespace character	
- \b	Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b	
- \uxxxx	Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx	

Quantifiers define quantities:

- n+	Matches any string that contains at least one n
- n*	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
- n?	Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n


*`.search()` and `.replace()`*

```java
let text = "Visit W3Schools!";
let n = text.search("W3Schools");
// OUTPUT for n = index pos. of pattern found start

let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
```

*Other JavaScript Built-In Syntax:*

**Rest**

- JavaScript provides the rest syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the rest of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a rest parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

```java
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```

**Spread**

- Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

```java
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

*JavaScript Try/Catch/Finally:*

```java
try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
```

- The fallback pattern is commonly implemented using exception handling. To implement the fallback pattern you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.

```java
function getScores() {
  try {
    const scores = scoringService.getScores();
    // store the scores so that we can use them later if the network is not available
    window.localStorage.setItem('scores', scores);
    return scores;
  } catch {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('scores');
  }
}
```

*JavaScript Destructuring:*

```java
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
```

and

```java
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```
