`git` Command Tips:
- To stage/"commit" a change, use `git commit -am "{commit message here}"`
- To upload all staged commits, `git push`
- The `git fetch` command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on, which is useful if you want to see what changes have been made on the remote server, without making any changes to your local copies.
- With `git pull`, you additionally merge the origin branch to your local branch. 
- Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
